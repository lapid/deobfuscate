# Evaluation sets

Built by `evaluation/corpus.py` and `evaluation/build.py`; do not edit by hand. Described in
`docs/evaluation.md`.

**Do not read the `test` files to get ideas for rules.**

## Files

- `corpus_<split>.jsonl`: 7,000 clean texts per split, with origin, credit, address and licence.
- `real_<split>.jsonl`: real text messages containing HTML entities, with the decoded text as
  the expected output (136 dev, 133 test).
- `<split>/clean.jsonl`: the corpus plus generated hard negatives. Must come back unchanged.
- `<split>/obfuscated.jsonl`: corpus texts obfuscated by our generator, plus the real messages.

## Sources and licences

These files are **not** under the project's MIT licence. Every row carries its own `source`,
`url` and `licence` fields, and those govern that row.

## Changes made to the source text

- Documents were split into sentences and short runs of sentences; whitespace was collapsed.
  Wikipedia and Wikinews texts come from article introductions. Stack Exchange texts come from
  question bodies with markup removed and code blocks dropped. Only personal messages ("ham")
  were taken from the SMS collection.
- In `obfuscated.jsonl`, the `text` field is the source text altered by our obfuscator; the
  unaltered text is in `expected`. These altered rows are adaptations and stay under the licence
  of their source row (share-alike where that licence requires it).
- Wikipedia, Wikinews and Stack Exchange were sampled on 2026-10-08.
